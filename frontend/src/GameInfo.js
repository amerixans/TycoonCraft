<h1>🏛️ Welcome to TycoonCraft!</h1>

<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
TycoonCraft is a civilization-building crafting game where you combine basic elements to discover new objects, 
build your empire, and progress through ten eras of human history—from humble Hunter-Gatherers all the way to Beyond!
</p>

<p>
Created by <strong>Alex</strong>, TycoonCraft combines the satisfaction of discovery with strategic resource management. 
Every combination you try might unlock something new, and every object you place generates resources to fuel your civilization's growth.
</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<h3>🎯 Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Discover Objects:</strong> You start with 4 basic objects (Rock, Stick, Water, Dirt). Drag any two objects 
  to the crafting slots and combine them to discover new items!</li>
  <li><strong>Place Objects:</strong> Once discovered, drag objects from the sidebar onto the canvas to place them. 
  Placed objects generate coins and time crystals over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage Resources:</strong> Watch your coins and crystals grow! Use coins to place more objects, and use 
  time crystals to unlock new eras.</li>
</ol>

<h3>⚗️ Crafting System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Combine ANY two discovered objects to create something new</li>
  <li>Each unique combination generates a brand new object via AI</li>
  <li>Discoveries are shared globally—if someone else found it first, you'll get their result</li>
  <li>Click the ℹ️ icon on any object to see its full stats before placing</li>
</ul>

<h3>🗺️ Canvas Placement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The canvas is a grid where you can place your objects</li>
  <li>Canvas size grows as you progress through eras</li>
  <li>Each object has a footprint (size) and generates resources while active</li>
  <li>Click on placed objects to remove them (you'll get a partial refund)</li>
  <li>Use the zoom controls to navigate large canvases</li>
</ul>

<h3>🚀 Era Progression</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Progress through 10 eras: Hunter-Gatherer → Agriculture → Metallurgy → Steam & Industry → 
  Electric Age → Computing → Futurism → Interstellar → Arcana → Beyond</li>
  <li>Each era has unique objects and a special <strong>keystone object</strong> (marked with 🔑)</li>
  <li><strong>NEW!</strong> Keystones automatically unlock new eras when you place them on the canvas!</li>
  <li>Look for keystone combinations: Fire + Wood = Campfire (unlocks Agriculture)</li>
  <li>Keystones are powerful objects with limited placement (usually 1-3 per civilization)</li>
  <li>You can still manually unlock eras by spending time crystals (💎) if you prefer</li>
  <li>Cross-era crafting: Combining objects from different eras creates objects in the higher era</li>
</ul>

<h3>💡 Tips & Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Experiment! Try combining everything with everything</li>
  <li>Balance your economy: place objects that generate good income</li>
  <li>Some objects generate time crystals—these are crucial for progression</li>
  <li>Pay attention to object footprints to maximize your canvas space</li>
  <li>Use the search bar in the sidebar to quickly find specific objects</li>
</ul>
