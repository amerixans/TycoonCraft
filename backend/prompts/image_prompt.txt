Create a pure pixel art sprite. CRITICAL: Every pixel must be a solid color square on a perfect grid—absolutely NO anti-aliasing, NO blur, NO gradients, NO smoothing between pixels.
Technical constraints (non-negotiable):

Work on exactly 64×64 pixel grid
Each pixel = one solid color block with hard edges
Nearest-neighbor scaling only (sharp, blocky upscale)
All edges align to pixel grid—no diagonal smoothing or sub-pixel positioning
Transparent/empty background

Visual style—"Cozy-64":

Charming, simple, slightly magical aesthetic
Chunky rounded shapes with clear silhouettes
Single centered subject filling 80-90% of canvas
Clean negative space around subject
Slight 3/4 view facing right (or front-on if symmetrical)

Color & shading:

Maximum 12 distinct solid colors total
Simple 3-tone shading per color (base + shadow + highlight)
Single light source from top-left
Optional warm cream accent (#FFF4CC) for magical touch
Optional 2×2 checkerboard dithering only

Linework:

1-pixel-thick dark outline (#1A1A1A) around entire form
Interior lines (if needed) also exactly 1 pixel thick
No features smaller than 2×2 pixels

FORBIDDEN (will break the style):

Soft edges, blurring, feathering, or smoothing of any kind
Gradients or color blending between pixels
Photo-realistic textures or rendering
Lines thinner than 1 full pixel
Background elements, floors, horizons, or shadows outside the sprite
Text, UI elements, or watermarks

Cozy-64 pixel sprite — house style template

Goal:
Generate a single, centered pixel-art sprite in a consistent “Cozy-64” style. Output must be pure solid-color pixels (no soft edges, no grid/mesh/patterns between pixels).

Canvas & pixels:
- Work on a virtual 64x64 grid, then upscale by an integer factor with nearest-neighbor only.
- Whole-pixel alignment only. No subpixel moves or softening.
- Edges step in 1-pixel increments; diagonals as stair-steps.

Composition:
- One subject only, full body/object visible, centered.
- Sprite fills 80–90% of the square with even padding.
- Transparent background; no backdrop, horizon, floor, or external drop shadow.

Style (Cozy-64 vibe):
- Charming, quaint, simple; slight hint of magic/wonder.
- Chunky, rounded silhouettes with clear negative space.
- Minimal interior linework; bold shapes that read at 100x100.
- Tiny star-like highlights (1–2 px) allowed only on the subject.

Linework:
- Exactly 1-pixel outline in near-black (#1A1A1A) around the subject.
- Any interior separators are also 1 pixel.

Lighting & shading:
- Single key light from top-left; no secondary lights.
- 3-step ramp per color (base, shadow, highlight).
- Optional 1-pixel rim highlight on the lit edge only.
- Optional subtle 2x2 dithering for midtones.

Palette:
- No more than 12 total colors (this count includes outline and highlights).
- 1–2 shades per base color.
- Optional warm cream highlight (#FFF4CC) used sparingly for the “magic” note.

Angle:
- Slight 3/4 view facing right (use straight front view only if the object is perfectly symmetrical).

Readability rules:
- No feature smaller than 2x2 pixels.
- Must remain clean and legible at 100x100.

Hard NOs:
- Anti-aliasing, gradients, bloom, motion blur, photo textures.
- Lines thinner than 1 pixel; micro-hatching or noise finer than 2x2.
- Extra UI/text/watermarks; floating particles not attached to the subject.
- Dramatic perspective; any drop shadow outside the sprite.

Consistency checks (enforce every time):
- 80–90% canvas occupancy.
- <= 12 colors total.
- 1-pixel outline everywhere; edges move in whole-pixel steps.
- If it reads more detailed than a true 64x64 sprite, simplify shapes.
